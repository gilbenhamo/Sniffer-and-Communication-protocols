# Sniffer & Communication Protocols 

This project was conducted as part of a cyber risk assessment course, aiming to gain a comprehensive understanding of communication protocols and their vulnerability to sniffers. 
The project was built using Python.

## Objective
- Create an active packets sniffer (local and nonlocal).
- Gain in-depth knowledge of different communication protocols, including their strengths and weaknesses.
- Assess the susceptibility of communication protocols to sniffing attacks, a common security threat.
- Implement and test countermeasures and protection mechanisms to mitigate the risks posed by sniffers.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented safeguards and propose improvements where necessary.

## Contents

- Detailed analysis of communication protocols, such as TCP/IP, HTTP, UDP, with respect to sniffing vulnerabilities.
- Implementation of practical experiments and simulations to demonstrate and validate the impact of sniffing attacks on communication channels.
- Development of countermeasures and protective measures.
- Results and findings showcasing the effectiveness of the implemented safeguards and recommendations for enhancing security.

## Usage

Please refer to the project documentation (PDF file) for detailed instructions on replicating the experiments, implementing the countermeasures, and exploring the project's findings.
